# Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship

> As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:
>
>Not only working software,
>
>                but also **well-crafted software**
>
>Not only responding to change,
>
>                but also **steadily adding value**
>    
>Not only individuals and interactions,
>
>                but also **a community of professionals**
>    
>Not only customer collaboration,
>
>                but also **productive partnerships**
>
>That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
